        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the second day in Shanghai with Yuxi and Eric â€” and our first day out having fun.</p><p>Around noon, Eric and I took a taxi to Yuxiâ€™s sisterâ€™s place, where he was staying. Finally, the three of us were together in Shanghai!</p><p>After we met up, we took the metro to see the <em>Gundam</em> statue in Shanghai. Itâ€™s located in a park next to a popular mall called LaLaport. Yuxi took a photo with the !WAITING!.</p><p><img src="yuxi-with-freedom-gundam.jpg" alt="Yuxi with Freedom Gundam"></p><p>Then we went into the mall â€” and there were even more statues inside! The back of !WAITING! had already caught our eyes, but the front looked even coooooler!</p><p><img src="mighty-strike-freedom-gundam-back.jpg" alt="Mighty Strike Freedom Gundam back"><br><img src="yuxi-with-mighty-strike-freedom-gundam.jpg" alt="Yuxi with Mighty Strike Freedom Gundam"></p><p>Thereâ€™s also a <em>Gundam</em>-themed store inside, with many <em>Gundam</em> models on display.</p><p><img src="freedom-gundam.jpg" alt="Freedom Gundam"></p><p>After dinner, we headed to the Pudong New Area â€” Shanghaiâ€™s CBD and the wealthiest district in China. We wanted to experience the concrete jungle. So we rented shared bikes and started a 10-kilometer (6-mile) ride that lasted over an hour.</p><p><img src="cycling-record.jpg" alt="Cycling record"><br><img src="yuxi-eric-and-bicycles.jpg" alt="Yuxi, Eric and bicycles"><br><img src="cycling-in-trees.jpg" alt="Cycling in trees"><br><img src="yuxi-riding-a-bicycle.jpg" alt="Yuxi riding a bicycle"></p><p>Once we reached Pudong, we were welcomed by the three most iconic towers in Lujiazui, Shanghai.</p><p><img src="Lujiazui-towers.jpg" alt="Lujiazui towers"><br>From left to right: Jin Mao Tower (421m &#x2F; 1,380 ft), Shanghai World Financial Center (492m &#x2F; 1,600 ft), and Shanghai Tower (632m &#x2F; 2,000 ft).</p><p><img src="standard-chartered.jpg" alt="Standard Chartered!"><br>Standard Chartered! One of my favorite banks in the world!</p><p>Later we visited the Shanghai IFC Mall, one of the busiest commercial areas in China.</p><p><img src="ifc-mall-balloon.jpg" alt="IFC Mall Balloon"></p><p>Apple Pudong is located in the square outside the mall. Its above-ground section is a stunning cylindrical building made entirely of giant glass panels. Unfortunately, that entrance was temporarily closed, so we had to enter through another one.</p><p><img src="apple-pudong.jpg" alt="Apple Pudong"></p><p>After visiting Apple Pudong, Yuxi left to be with his family. Eric and I left Pudong to grab something to eat, and then returned again later. We also helped a couple from Jamaica find a Chinese restaurant â€” what a kind guy xD!</p><p><img src="oriental-pearl-tower.jpg" alt="Oriental Pearl Tower"></p><p>By that time, around 8 PM, the crowds had grown to insane levels. There was no way for us to cross the Huangpu River and meet up with Yuxi again. So we headed back to our hotel, a bit disappointed.</p><p>Later, Yuxi sent us some photos of the Bund and the river.</p><p><img src="shanghai-bund.jpg" alt="Shanghai bund"></p><p>The Bund features many European-style buildings â€” more specifically, European Neoclassical architecture. One example is the building of SPD Bank (Shanghai Pudong Development Bank).</p><p><img src="spd-bank-european-architecture.jpg" alt="SPD Bank European Architecture"></p><p>Back at the hotel, Eric opened Douyin (Chinese TikTok), and we were <em>shocked</em> by the crazy crowds at the Bund!</p><p><img src="crowded-bund-and-nanjing-road.jpg" alt="Crowded bund and Nanjing Road"></p><p>Honestly, it was a good thing we didnâ€™t go ðŸ¤“</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>International Labor Day! Finally, this long-anticipated vacation has arrived. Before it started, I was actually thinking Iâ€™d just stay home, do some programming, or play Minecraft during the break.</p><p>About two weeks before the holiday, Yuxi told me he will go to visit his sister in Shanghai. When I got that message, I felt a little sad. If he was going to Shanghai, we probably wouldnâ€™t get to hang out much during the vacation.</p><p>I considered tagging along, but I had already visited Shanghai last summer with Eric (see <a href="posts/shanghai-trip-2024/" title="Shanghai Trip 2024">Shanghai Trip 2024</a>). It didnâ€™t seem like a good idea to travel to the same place again so soon.</p><p>At first, I thought Iâ€™d just stay home. But Shanghai left me with such great memories that, in the endâ€”on a bit of an impulseâ€”I DECIDED TO GOOOOOOOOO WITH HIM!!</p><p>We got home from boring school on the last day of April, played Minecraft together, and defeated the Ender Dragon. Then on May 1st, we met up with some of our old classmates and had a lot of fun.</p><p><em>Yuxi and I were classmates in junior high. We spent three of the most memorable, emotional, and unforgettable years of our lives together.</em></p><p><img src="having-dinner-with-classmates.jpg" alt="Having dinner with classmates"><br>After dinner, Yuxi and I began our journey to Shanghai.</p><p><strong>A funny story happened on the plane.</strong><br>I was already exhausted after going through the security check and walking all the way to our gate. Once we boarded, I felt super thirsty. As we all know, liquids canâ€™t be brought on the plane, so I didnâ€™t have anything left to drink. I asked the flight attendant for some water. A kind lady brought me a cup, but it wasnâ€™t enoughâ€”I asked for another. She brought a second. Still not enough! I asked again and she handed me a third cup. ðŸ˜‚ In total, I drank five cups of water and at one point had three cups in my hand. When she passed me the third cup, the passenger sitting next to me started laughing.</p><p><img src="landing-in-shanghai.jpg" alt="Landing in Shanghai"><br>We landed at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 10:40 PM. I finished writing this post just now.</p><p>Technically, this is our first day in Shanghai, although we will stay in Shanghai for only 1 hour todat since we arrived so late.</p><p>Tomorrow, we plan to visit the <em>Gundam</em> statue. After that, weâ€™ll probably explore more around the city.</p><p>Itâ€™s my first time traveling with such a cherished classmateâ€”I hope there will be many more trips like this in the future. ðŸ˜­</p><p><img src="tickets.jpg" alt="Tickets"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Having a personal blog has been one of my dreams since I was young.</strong></p><p>I have created a Chinese-only blog since October 2023. As of late April 2025, that blog has reached almost 40k views in total.</p><p>My Chinese-only blog is called <em>mao mao de meng</em>, which means <em>Maomaoâ€™s Dream</em>. Maomao is my Chinese nickname, like my English nickname Mars. <em>Maomaoâ€™s Dream</em> appeared in my mind when I was taking a shower while I was struggling to name my first live website. It represents my dream of having it.<br>Visit <a href="https://www.maodream.com/"><em><strong>Maomaoâ€™s Dream</strong></em> (www.maodream.com)</a></p><p>As time came to 2025, Iâ€™ve started trying to socialize with friends from all over the world. I do have some foreign friends before, but only several and we hardly talk.</p><p>I remember it was a cool afternoon, I skipped school on that day since i wasnâ€™t feeling well. I was really bored and decided to try to make my first step into a brand-new zone.</p><p>I joined the official Discord server of CubeCraft, which is a Minecraft server I liked. There were some people in the voice channel. I taped join, started greeting and introducing myself, things began to change.</p><p>I had a lot of fun with my new friends <a href="https://tapy.me/shp1natqp">SHPINAT</a>, Soham and FELLGETS, later I met XY and Iris. I also built my first international Discord server.</p><p>I have many chinese friends obviously, and I have a Chinese-only blog as I mentioned before. But I have never tried to build an international website. Basically, thatâ€™s why I create <em><strong>Mars Inside</strong></em>.</p><p>For this brand-new blog, Iâ€™ll keep writing and sharing my stories and experiences, also interesting things.</p><p>If you like this blog, please support me by sharing it to your friends!<br>If youâ€™d like to know more about me, feel free to visit the <a href="/about/">About</a> page. I love making friends!</p>]]></content>
