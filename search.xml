        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The fourth day in Shanghai. None of us really wanted to admit it — but this was our last day to have fun in the city.</p><p>Around noon, we started discussing where to go. Yuxi suggested visiting a beach next to the Yangtze River, one of the two longest rivers in China. He wanted to see the place where the river flows into the sea. But Eric wasn’t very interested — he thought the Yangtze River in Shanghai wasn’t that impressive and, besides, it was way too far from our hotel. So in the end, Yuxi went alone from his sister’s place.</p><p>The weather was sunny and beautiful. Yuxi took some photos of the sea and shared them with us. I’ve always loved the sea and the ocean, especially on sunny days when the water sparkles <em>bo guang lin lin</em> (波光粼粼) — a traditional Chinese idiom that describes how sunlight reflects off rippling waves like shimmering fish scales.</p><p><img src="yangtze-river-1.jpg" alt="Yangtze River 1"></p><p>Living in an inland city, I rarely get the chance to see the sea. That kind of scene feels like a dreamland to me. Honestly, I felt a little regretful for not going with him.</p><p><img src="yangtze-river-2.jpg" alt="Yangtze River 2"></p><p>Later in the afternoon, Eric and I decided to visit <strong>Apple Jing’an</strong>, the largest Apple Store in Asia — and the second-largest in the world.</p><p><img src="apple-jingan.jpg" alt="Apple Jing&#39;an"></p><p><strong>Apple Jing’an</strong> is next to Jing’an Temple, a traditional temple in Jing’an District. The combination of traditional and modern technology feels quite amazing.</p><p><img src="jingan-temple.jpg" alt="Jing&#39;an Temple"><br><img src="selfie-in-front-of-jingan-temple.jpg" alt="Selfie in front of Jing&#39;an Temple"></p><p>Later we went to Blue Frog, a western foods restaurant. And had our the most expensive dinner in Shanghai 😂. I had a burger and SPAGHETTI! My favorite western food ever!</p><p><img src="spaghetti.jpg" alt="Spaghetti"><br><img src="eating-at-blue-frog.jpg" alt="Eating at Blue Frog"><br><img src="cheers.jpg" alt="Cheers!"><br><em>By the way, just water inside. We are good kids 😉.</em></p><p>After dinner, we went for a leisurely bike ride, wandering aimlessly through old Shanghai. And almost every road has a dedicated bike lane in Shanghai, specially for bikes and e-bikes. You can fully immerse yourself in the joy of cycling without worries.</p><p><img src="cycling-record.jpg" alt="Cycling record"></p><p>Yuxi’s flight is at 7 AM tomorrow morning, which means he needs to get up around 4. So he went back early at around 10 PM. Eric and I saw him off at the subway station and said our goodbyes. A feeling of reluctance welled up in my heart, because this farewell means the next time we meet will no longer be in Shanghai.</p><p><img src="say-goodbye-to-yuxi.jpg" alt="Say goodbye to Yuxi"></p><p>Tomorrow is the last day… and I don’t even have time to take another look at the city since my flight is at noon. Kinda sad.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The third day of our Shanghai trip was filled with both chill vibes and exciting moments.</p><p>After the intense biking on Day 2, we all slept like rocks. On the morning of May 3rd, Eric and I woke up a bit late and took things slow. Meanwhile, Yuxi’s father and sister brought him out shopping — though he wasn’t really into it 😂</p><p>In the afternoon, Eric and I headed out to meet Yuxi. We decided to meet at Jing’an Joy City, a mall in Jing’an District, Shanghai. Eric and I rode shared bikes there. As we stopped at a crosswalk near a footbridge next to the mall, waiting for the green light, I suddenly heard someone shouting. The voice came from the footbridge… and it was shouting my phone number?</p><p>Wait, what??</p><p>Then I realized — it was Yuxi! We’ve memorized each other’s phone numbers so well that we often use them as nicknames instead of real names. I burst out laughing and shouted Yuxi’s number back while Eric stood there confused, wondering who this random guy was yelling numbers at us. Yuxi even took a sneaky photo of me from the footbridge without asking 😡</p><p><img src="mars-riding-a-bicycle.jpg" alt="Mars riding a bicycle"></p><p>After crossing the street, Eric and I went up onto the footbridge and saw Yuxi had just rented a shared bike too. My turn to get some revenge and snap photos of him! 😋 lmao!</p><p><img src="yuxi-riding-a-bicycle.jpg" alt="Yuxi riding a bicycle"></p><p>Once we met up, we went into the mall to grab a bite. Inside, we saw a bunch of cosers — people dressed up as characters from anime or games. I took a few photos with some of them. In China, we call this <em>jiyou</em> (集邮), which literally means “stamp collecting” — because photos with different people kind of feel like collecting stamps, right?</p><p><img src="frieren-coser.jpg" alt="Frieren coser"></p><p>After wandering a bit, we finally decided to eat at a Korean barbecue restaurant. It had only opened a few months ago, so everything felt brand new. The food was also really tasty.</p><p><img src="barbecue.jpg" alt="Barbecue"></p><p>By the time we finished dinner, it was already past 10 PM, so we started riding our bikes back to the hotel. This time, Yuxi joined us as well. When we got back, we ended the day with a fun little KTV party at the hotel :)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the second day in Shanghai with Yuxi and Eric — and our first day out having fun.</p><p>Around noon, Eric and I took a taxi to Yuxi’s sister’s place, where he was staying. Finally, the three of us were together in Shanghai!</p><p>After we met up, we took the metro to see the <em>Gundam</em> statue in Shanghai. It’s located in a park next to a popular mall called LaLaport. Yuxi took a photo with the !WAITING!.</p><p><img src="yuxi-with-freedom-gundam.jpg" alt="Yuxi with Freedom Gundam"></p><p>Then we went into the mall — and there were even more statues inside! The back of !WAITING! had already caught our eyes, but the front looked even coooooler!</p><p><img src="mighty-strike-freedom-gundam-back.jpg" alt="Mighty Strike Freedom Gundam back"><br><img src="yuxi-with-mighty-strike-freedom-gundam.jpg" alt="Yuxi with Mighty Strike Freedom Gundam"></p><p>There’s also a <em>Gundam</em>-themed store inside, with many <em>Gundam</em> models on display.</p><p><img src="freedom-gundam.jpg" alt="Freedom Gundam"></p><p>After dinner, we headed to the Pudong New Area — Shanghai’s CBD and the wealthiest district in China. We wanted to experience the concrete jungle. So we rented shared bikes and started a 10-kilometer (6-mile) ride that lasted over an hour.</p><p><img src="cycling-record.jpg" alt="Cycling record"><br><img src="yuxi-eric-and-bicycles.jpg" alt="Yuxi, Eric and bicycles"><br><img src="cycling-in-trees.jpg" alt="Cycling in trees"><br><img src="yuxi-riding-a-bicycle.jpg" alt="Yuxi riding a bicycle"></p><p>Once we reached Pudong, we were welcomed by the three most iconic towers in Lujiazui, Shanghai.</p><p><img src="Lujiazui-towers.jpg" alt="Lujiazui towers"><br>From left to right: Jin Mao Tower (421m &#x2F; 1,380 ft), Shanghai World Financial Center (492m &#x2F; 1,600 ft), and Shanghai Tower (632m &#x2F; 2,000 ft).</p><p><img src="standard-chartered.jpg" alt="Standard Chartered!"><br>Standard Chartered! One of my favorite banks in the world!</p><p>Later we visited the Shanghai IFC Mall, one of the busiest commercial areas in China.</p><p><img src="ifc-mall-balloon.jpg" alt="IFC Mall Balloon"></p><p>Apple Pudong is located in the square outside the mall. Its above-ground section is a stunning cylindrical building made entirely of giant glass panels. Unfortunately, that entrance was temporarily closed, so we had to enter through another one.</p><p><img src="apple-pudong.jpg" alt="Apple Pudong"></p><p>After visiting Apple Pudong, Yuxi left to be with his family. Eric and I left Lujiazui to grab something to eat, and then returned again later. We also helped a couple from Jamaica find a Chinese restaurant — what a kind guy xD!</p><p><img src="oriental-pearl-tower.jpg" alt="Oriental Pearl Tower"></p><p>By that time, around 8 PM, the crowds had grown to insane levels. There was no way for us to cross the Huangpu River and meet up with Yuxi again. So we headed back to our hotel, a bit disappointed.</p><p>Later, Yuxi sent us some photos of the Bund and the river.</p><p><img src="shanghai-bund.jpg" alt="Shanghai bund"></p><p>The Bund features many European-style buildings — more specifically, European Neoclassical architecture. One example is the building of SPD Bank (Shanghai Pudong Development Bank).</p><p><img src="spd-bank-european-architecture.jpg" alt="SPD Bank European Architecture"></p><p>Back at the hotel, Eric opened Douyin (Chinese TikTok), and we were <em>shocked</em> by the crazy crowds at the Bund!</p><p><img src="crowded-bund-and-nanjing-road.jpg" alt="Crowded bund and Nanjing Road"></p><p>Honestly, it was a good thing we didn’t go 🤓</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>International Labor Day! Finally, this long-anticipated vacation has arrived. Before it started, I was actually thinking I’d just stay home, do some programming, or play Minecraft during the break.</p><p>About two weeks before the holiday, Yuxi told me he will go to visit his sister in Shanghai. When I got that message, I felt a little sad. If he was going to Shanghai, we probably wouldn’t get to hang out much during the vacation.</p><p>I considered tagging along, but I had already visited Shanghai last summer with Eric (see <a href="posts/shanghai-trip-2024/" title="Shanghai Trip 2024">Shanghai Trip 2024</a>). It didn’t seem like a good idea to travel to the same place again so soon.</p><p>At first, I thought I’d just stay home. But Shanghai left me with such great memories that, in the end—on a bit of an impulse—I DECIDED TO GOOOOOOOOO WITH HIM!!</p><p>We got home from boring school on the last day of April, played Minecraft together, and defeated the Ender Dragon. Then on May 1st, we met up with some of our old classmates and had a lot of fun.</p><p><em>Yuxi and I were classmates in junior high. We spent three of the most memorable, emotional, and unforgettable years of our lives together.</em></p><p><img src="having-dinner-with-classmates.jpg" alt="Having dinner with classmates"><br>After dinner, Yuxi and I began our journey to Shanghai.</p><p><strong>A funny story happened on the plane.</strong><br>I was already exhausted after going through the security check and walking all the way to our gate. Once we boarded, I felt super thirsty. As we all know, liquids can’t be brought on the plane, so I didn’t have anything left to drink. I asked the flight attendant for some water. A kind lady brought me a cup, but it wasn’t enough—I asked for another. She brought a second. Still not enough! I asked again and she handed me a third cup. 😂 In total, I drank five cups of water and at one point had three cups in my hand. When she passed me the third cup, the passenger sitting next to me started laughing.</p><p><img src="landing-in-shanghai.jpg" alt="Landing in Shanghai"><br>We landed at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 10:40 PM. I finished writing this post just now.</p><p>Technically, this is our first day in Shanghai, although we will stay in Shanghai for only 1 hour todat since we arrived so late.</p><p>Tomorrow, we plan to visit the <em>Gundam</em> statue. After that, we’ll probably explore more around the city.</p><p>It’s my first time traveling with such a cherished classmate—I hope there will be many more trips like this in the future. 😭</p><p><img src="tickets.jpg" alt="Tickets"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Having a personal blog has been one of my dreams since I was young.</strong></p><p>I have created a Chinese-only blog since October 2023. As of late April 2025, that blog has reached almost 40k views in total.</p><p>My Chinese-only blog is called <em>mao mao de meng</em>, which means <em>Maomao’s Dream</em>. Maomao is my Chinese nickname, like my English nickname Mars. <em>Maomao’s Dream</em> appeared in my mind when I was taking a shower while I was struggling to name my first live website. It represents my dream of having it.<br>Visit <a href="https://www.maodream.com/"><em><strong>Maomao’s Dream</strong></em> (www.maodream.com)</a></p><p>As time came to 2025, I’ve started trying to socialize with friends from all over the world. I do have some foreign friends before, but only several and we hardly talk.</p><p>I remember it was a cool afternoon, I skipped school on that day since i wasn’t feeling well. I was really bored and decided to try to make my first step into a brand-new zone.</p><p>I joined the official Discord server of CubeCraft, which is a Minecraft server I liked. There were some people in the voice channel. I taped join, started greeting and introducing myself, things began to change.</p><p>I had a lot of fun with my new friends <a href="https://tapy.me/shp1natqp">SHPINAT</a>, Soham and FELLGETS, later I met XY and Iris. I also built my first international Discord server.</p><p>I have many chinese friends obviously, and I have a Chinese-only blog as I mentioned before. But I have never tried to build an international website. Basically, that’s why I create <em><strong>Mars Inside</strong></em>.</p><p>For this brand-new blog, I’ll keep writing and sharing my stories and experiences, also interesting things.</p><p>If you like this blog, please support me by sharing it to your friends!<br>If you’d like to know more about me, feel free to visit the <a href="/about/">About</a> page. I love making friends!</p>]]></content>
